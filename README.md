## Reflection

This was a 4 month project, and is a part of a system made in collaboration with Cordel Norge, as a bachelorproject. Goals for this applicaiton is a system for Cordel to see and monitor errors and users.

It has been challenging working with alot of new software, and therefore posing as a very good learning experience.

This systems relies on Material for widgets. Shared Preferences, flutter_spinkit, toastare examples of packages and libraries used in this project.

This application talks with a backend made with C# and a database made in PostgreSQL.
